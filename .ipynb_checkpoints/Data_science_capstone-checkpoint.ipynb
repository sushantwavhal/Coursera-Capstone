    "The Seattle government can deploy a system that can alert drivers, health system, and police to remind them to practice caution and alertness in case of an incident. As a step towards this solution I will be building a model than will <b>predict the severity of an accident.</b><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "This model can be the <b>driving mechanism</b> that could <b>warn people</b>, given the weather and the road conditions about the <b>possibility of a car accident and how severe</b> it would be, so that they would <b>drive more carefully or even change their travel</b> if possible. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In accident severity modeling, the <b>input vectors</b> are the characteristics of the accident, such as <b>driver behavior and attributes of vehicle, highway and environment characteristics</b> while the <b>output vector</b> is the corresponding <b>class of accident severity.</b><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "By recognizing the <b>key factors that influence accident severity</b>, the solution may be of great utility to various <b>Government Departments/Authorities like Police, R&B and Transport</b> from public policy point of view. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of analysis and modeling can be used by these Departments to take appropriate measures to <b>reduce accident impact</b> and thereby <b>improve traffic safety</b>. It is also useful to the Insurers in terms of reduced claims and better underwriting as well as rate making."
