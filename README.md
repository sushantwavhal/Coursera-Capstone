This project focusses on building a Machine Learning model to classify the severity of a car accident. <br> In accident severity modeling, the input vectors are the characteristics of the accident, such as <b>driver behavior and attributes of vehicle, highway and environment characteristics</b> while the output vector is the corresponding <b>class of accident severity.</b>
